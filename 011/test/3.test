While cosmologists may be fascinated by what dark matter does, particle physicists are fascinated by what dark matter is. 
For us, dark matter should be—naturally—a particle, albeit one that is still lurking hidden in our data. 
For the last few decades, we’ve had a tantalizing guess as to what this particle might be—namely, the lightest of a new class of supersymmetric particles. 
Supersymmetry is an extension to the Standard Model of particles and forces that nicely addresses lingering questions about the stability of the mass of the Higgs boson, the unification of the forces, and the particle nature of dark matter. 
In fact, supersymmetry predicts a vast number of new particles—one for each particle we already know about. 
Yet while one of those new particles could constitute dark matter, to many of us that would be just a happy byproduct.
But after analyzing data from the first (2010–2012) and second (2015–2018) runs of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), we haven’t found supersymmetric particles yet—indeed, no new particles at all, beyond the Higgs boson. 
So, while we continue to hunt for supersymmetry, we’re also taking a fresh look at what our cosmology colleagues can tell us about dark matter. 
It is the strongest experimental evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model, after all.

In fact, some might say that a principal goal of the LHC and future colliders will be to create and study dark matter. 
For that to happen, there must be a means for the visible universe and the dark universe to communicate with each other. 
In other words, the constituents of the particles that we collide must be capable of interacting with the putative dark-matter particles via fundamental forces. A force requires a force carrier, or boson. 
The electromagnetic force is carried by the photon, the weak nuclear force by so-called vector bosons, and so on. Interactions between dark matter and normal matter should be no different: 
They could happen by exchanging dark bosons.
Even if our detectors are oblivious to the dark bosons themselves, we have some hope of identifying them if they have some tiny interaction with observable particles—in other words, if they are not completely dark. Given how feeble these interactions would be, the Large Hadron Collider could already be producing these particles and we simply haven’t been able to notice them yet. 
After being created in the LHC when two protons collide, a dark boson might decay into dark-matter particles, which would escape our detectors without leaving a trace. But we could deduce their presence by adding up all the particles we did observe and looking for an imbalance of momentum, indicating that something had gone missing. 
Alternatively, dark bosons could decay into ordinary particles, such as quarks, and leave clear patterns in our data. 
We could do some particle forensics to infer the properties of the unseen bosons. This is just the sort of job for which the LHC detectors were designed, and we are continually scouring our collider data for these signals.
In doing dark boson searches this way, though, we have made one assumption that might not be warranted: that the dark boson decays instantaneously. 
What if it doesn’t? 
The dark universe, in order to be dark, has to be sequestered from the normal universe in some way. 
This can cause dark bosons to survive for a short—but measurable—moment before disintegrating back into normal matter. 
The debris of the disintegration would not show up in our experiments at the point where the two protons collided, but displaced by some significant distance. 
The LHC experiments were designed to look for particles originating from the interaction point. 
Tracing the trajectories of long-lived particles (dark or not) is complicated by several factors. 
They would be composed of fewer measurements, making it harder to connect the dots; they would follow atypical geometric paths, further hampering our pattern-recognition algorithms; and they could produce signals that would arrive much later than the usual algorithms anticipate. 
But this is just the kind of challenge physicists embrace. By reviving decades-old tricks and inventing brand new methods, we have modified our algorithms to be sensitive to these atypical particle patterns. 
We think we can now detect dark bosons that decay up to several meters away from the place of origin, which covers most plausible scenarios. 
It almost doesn’t even matter what the dark boson decays into, as long as particles of normal matter, which our detectors will register, end up in the debris.
So far, we have found nothing in the data from the first, low-energy run of the LHC. 
But we are still working on data from the second, higher-energy run.
With the addition of these techniques to the supersymmetric searches that have come before it, we now have an excellent chance to discover dark matter, a dark force, or both. Considering that it has so far delivered only 1 percent of the total amount of data it will ultimately produce, the LHC’s search for dark particles has really only just begun.

Mattel’s AI nanny, called Aristotle, recently gained the notorious distinction of being subject to a bipartisan protest in the US Congress. Plus, there was a petition against it with over 15,000 signatures. The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, which organized the petition, argued that Aristotle is a consumerist ploy. It “attempts to replace the care, judgment and companionship of loving family members with faux nurturing and conversation from a robot designed to sell products and build brand loyalty.”
Canning Aristotle has at least one unfortunate consequence: We close off one channel of learning how kids grow up interacting with an AI as it becomes increasingly integrated in both schools and homes.Mattel / YouTube

Aristotle, designed to interact with kids, was based on the same technologies as virtual assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa. It could teach lessons, and calm them. The Guardian suggested that it might “reinforce good manners in kids, and even help kids learn a foreign language.” But it could also watch and listen to them. Aristotle’s Bluetooth camera, embedded in a cylindrical speaker-body, was poised to gaze unblinkingly in novel territory: a child’s bedroom. The company eventually conceded that Aristotle “did not fully align with Mattel’s new technology strategy.” Aristotle soon became Socrates, as it were, forced to drink hemlock at the hands of an enraged mob.

Yet canning Aristotle has at least one unfortunate consequence: We close off one channel of learning how kids grow up interacting with an AI as it becomes increasingly integrated in both schools and homes. The fact is that children interact with AI quite differently than adults do. Recently, the MIT Media Lab began studying how children between the ages of three and ten interact with AI in a monitored setting. This included Amazon Alexa and Google Home, digital assistants in cylindrical speakers, Julie Chatbot, an Android phone app that tells jokes and plays games with its interlocutor, and Cozmo, a wheeled robot that recognizes faces while showing artificial emotions on its own face.

Last year at a conference at Stanford University, the researchers began sharing some interesting results. For instance, children seem to overestimate the intelligence of the AIs they interacted with. Surprisingly, most of the older children thought the AIs might be smarter than themselves, whereas the children younger than six weren’t as sure. The researchers also found that children judge the tone and prosody of an AI’s synthesized speech differently than adults do. One of the researchers, Randi Williams, discovered that children seem to prefer Alexa’s voice for its “energy,” while an adult like Williams might prefer Google Home’s voice for sounding more human-like. “In future work,” the researchers concluded, “we hope to design interactions where children are able to tinker with and program the agents and thus expand their perception of their own intelligence and different ways to develop it.”

But it may be negligent, given how impressionable children are, to leave them alone, unsupervised, with an AI. A recent study found that children ages seven to nine are more likely than adults to conform to the behavior of Nao, a small humanoid robot. The researchers—from the UK, Germany, and Belgium—found that children often fall in line with the judgements of robots tasked with matching one of several lines to a reference line of the same length, even when the robot judgements are clearly wrong. Another study found that robots can “influence children to change their judgments about moral transgressions,” like whether it is okay to tease or hit other kids. Without a supervising adult, children might learn inappropriate behaviors from AI, which is why Stefania Druga, a graduate student in the Personal Robots Group at MIT Media Lab, told The Globe and Mail that parents are crucial intermediaries between children and AI.

Parents can also rely on AIs as distractions from distractions. For example, Amy Blake, an Ontario parent of two young children, has seen a reduction in her children’s screen time thanks to Google Home. The virtual assistant plays music and reads stories like Rapunzel to her children, replacing hours of time that might otherwise be squandered staring at what a TED Talk called the “nightmare videos of children’s YouTube.”

Williams wants more from child-oriented AI—a personalized tutor, for starters. In June, on a Future of Life Institute podcast, she said, “We found educational research that says that your vocabulary at the age of five, is a direct predictor of your PSAT score in the 11th grade. And as we all know, your PSAT score is a predictor of your SAT score. Your SAT score is a predictor of your future income, and potential in life, and all these great things.” AI can not only help expose children to a richer vocabulary in engaging conversations, but also encourage curiosity. “We think about how the personality of the robot is shaping the child as a learner. So, how is the robot teaching the child to have a growth mindset, and teaching them to persevere, to continue learning better? Those are the kinds of things that we want to instill, and AI can do that.”
